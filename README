This is a puppet module to set up buildbot masters and slaves.

It was tested on RHEL and CentOS, with buildbot 0.8.7 and 0.8.8.

It assumes buildbot is installed from packages.
It creates a user called buildbot, and creates a layout under
  $HOME/master
  $HOME/slave
respectively, according to its role.
It installs cron.d entries to ensure they get started on bootup.


local setup
-----------

If master and slave are on the same machine, you can just test it with
the following two defines in your node declaration:
 

    buildbot::master { 'default': }
    buildbot::slave { 'default': }

Note that this sets up a default buildbot building pyflakes.  This default
setup is just meant for testing, it's not secure.

separate setup
--------------

Usually a slave is on a different machine than a master.


    buildbot::slave { 'default':
        connection => 'masterhost:9989'
    }

hiera configuration
-------------------

buildbot::home: to specify an alternative buildbot home directory
